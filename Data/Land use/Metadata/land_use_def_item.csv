"6671","Agriculture area under organic agric.","'Agriculture'' area certified organic and/or in conversion to organic.","","","",""
"6621","Arable land","The total of areas under temporary crops, temporary meadows and pastures, and land with temporary fallow.  Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.","","","",""
"6620","Cropland","Land used for cultivation of crops. The total of areas under ''Arable land'' and ''Permanent crops''.","","","",""
"6646","Forest land","Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 metres and a canopy cover of more than 10 per cent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. Excludes land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use, and land that is predominantly used for maintenance and restoration of environmental function. Explanatory notes:• Forest land is determined both by the presence of trees and by the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 metres in situ• Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but that are expected to reach a canopy cover of 10 per cent and tree height of 5 metres. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked owing to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and that are expected to be regenerated within five years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify the use of a longer time frame• Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas• May include forest land in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas, such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural orspiritual interest• Includes windbreaks, shelter belts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 metres• Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or is expected to reach, a canopy cover of 10 per cent and tree height of 5 metres• Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless of whether this area is classified as land area or not• Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met• Some agroforestry systems such as the taungya system, where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest• Excludes: tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit-tree plantations (→Permanent crops), oil palm plantations, rubber and Christmas trees (→Permanent crops) and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover","","","",""
"6690","Land area equipped for irrigation","Land area equipped with irrigation infrastructure and equipment to provide water to crops, which are in working order. The equipment does not have to be used during the reference year. The area equipped for irrigation covers areas equipped for fully controlled irrigation by any of the methods of surface, sprinkler or localized irrigation. It also includes areas under partially controlled irrigation methods of spate irrigation (controlling flood waters to water crops), equipped wetlands and inland valley bottoms and equipped flood recession. It excludes manual watering of plants using buckets, watering cans or other devices.","","","",""
"6655","Land under perm. meadows and pastures","Land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops through cultivation or naturally (wild prairie or grazing land). Permanent meadows and pastures on which trees and shrubs are grown should be recorded under this heading only if the growing of forage crops is the most important use of the area. Measures may be taken to keep or increase productivity of the land (i.e., use of fertilizers, mowing or systematic grazing by domestic animals.) This class includes:• Grazing in wooded areas (agroforestry areas, for example)• Grazing in shrubby zones (heath, maquis, garigue)• Grassland in the plain or low mountain areas used for grazing: land crossed during transhumance where the animals spend a part of the year (approximately 100 days) without returning to the holding in the evening: mountain and subalpine meadows and similar; and steppes and dry meadows used for pasture.","","","",""
"6650","Land under permanent crops","Land cultivated with long-term crops which do not have to be replanted for several years (such as cocoa and coffee), land under trees and shrubs producing flowers (such as roses and jasmine), and nurseries (except those for forest trees, which should be classified under ""Forestry""). Permanent meadows and pastures are excluded from land under permanent crops.","","","",""
"6717","Other naturally regenerated forest","Naturally regenerated forest where there are clearly visible indications of human activities.Explanatory notes:1. Includes selectively logged-over areas, areas regenerating following agricultural land use, areas recovering from human-induced fires, etc.2. Includes forests where it is not possible to distinguish whether planted or naturally regenerated.3. Includes forests with a mix of naturally regenerated trees and planted/seeded trees, and where the naturally regenerated trees are expected to constitute more than 50 percent of the growing stock at stand maturity.","","","",""
"6716","Planted Forest","Forest predominantly composed of trees established through planting and/or deliberate seeding.Explanatory notes1. In this context, predominantly means that the planted/seeded trees are expected to constitute more than 50 percent of the growing stock at maturity.2. Includes coppice from trees that were originally planted or seeded.3. Includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.4. Excludes self-sown trees of introduced species.","","","",""
"6714","Primary Forest","Naturally regenerated forest of native species, where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed.Explanatory note:1. Some key characteristics of primary forests are:• they show natural forest dynamics, such as natural tree species composition, occurrence of dead wood, natural age structure and natural regeneration processes;• the area is large enough to maintain its natural characteristics; • there has been no known significant human intervention or the last significant human intervention was long enough ago to have allowed the natural species composition and processes to have become re-established.","","","",""
