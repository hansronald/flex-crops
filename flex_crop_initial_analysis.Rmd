## Some key findings
* **Global flex crop production as proportion of total crop production is increasing and could pass non flex crops in a near future**
* **Several countries from the former Sovietunion are dominating of the production of rapeseed, sugarbeet and sunflower seed**
* **Market concentration is in general lower for the emerging flex crops than of flex crops.**
* **On a global level yield of flex crops has fallen over time.**


## Which nations are the main producers and has the largest area harvested in 2017?

### Plots of countries with highest production, area harvested and yield of flex crops.

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}

production_year = "2017"
measure = "Production"
n_countries = 6

point_plot(crop_data, category = "Flex crop",
           measure = measure, production_year, n_countries, x_axis_text = "tonnes (millions)")

```

As expected, the US, Brazil and Argentina have the greates production of Soybeans. Brazil and India have the most of sugar cane production. Indonesia and Malaysia ha most of the Oil palm fruit and the US, China, Brazil and Argentina have the most Maize.

Interesting is that in the top 20 there are some eastern european countries for both Soybeans and Maize, Ukraine especially but also Romania, Serbia and Hungary.

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}

production_year = "2017"
measure = "Area harvested"
n_countries = 8

point_plot(crop_data, category = "Flex crop",
           measure = measure, production_year, n_countries, x_axis_text = "tonnes (millions)")

```

## Market concentration
The Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman Index (HHI) is a measure of market concentration (Investopedia 2019, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) and to determine the competativeness of a market. According to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission of the United States of America (Department of Justice 2010) the concentration of a specific market can be measured by the following ranges

* Unconcentrated Markets: HHI below 1500
* Moderately Concentrated Markets: HHI between 1500 and 2500
* Highly Concentrated Markets: HHI above 2500

### Market concentration of global production of flex crops

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}

category = "Flex crop"
measure = c("Production")
plot_HH_index(crop_data, category, measure)

```

Here we can see that in terms of production the market concentration went down on Soybeans, which is in line with Oliviera & Schneider (2016) that the concentration withered with the expansion of production in Brazil and China. The market concentration for oil palm fruit has increased, and is the only one which today would clearly fall into the category "highly concentrated market". The reasons for this are captured by this quote by the president of the Colombian FEDEPALMA:

> Oil palm industry development of our world leader, Indonesia, is underpinned by cheap labor force, low production costs and large swathes of land given under concession and other forms by the government. But those conditions are neither easy to find somewhere else, especially in Latin America, nor sustainable. Thus, oil palm agroindustry must build and consolidate com- petitive advantages over more solid bases (Hunsberger & Alonso-Fradejas 2016)

### Market concentration of global production of emerging flex crops

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}

category = "Emerging flex crop"
measure = c("Production")
plot_HH_index(crop_data, category, measure)

```

Market concentration is in general lower for the emerging flex crops, with coconuts in the top and it has a positive trend. In the last decade also the market concentration of sunflower has increased significantly and could soon be considered a moderately concentrated market.

## Break point analysis of global production of flex crops
Plots time series of the aggregated total production of individual flex crops and estimates two breakpoints.

### Flex crops production
The two vertical lines are the breakpoints (using segmented package in r specifying n = 2 breaks). Note that I have not actually had time to look into what the criterias for finding the breakpoints are, nor can I motivate why I have chosen 2 breakpoints. It is also possible to put in starting values (e.g. 1995 and 2012 for Soybean production where it seem to have breakpoints just eyballing it.)

```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Production"
#crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, flex_crops, measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = flex_crops, y_axis_text = "Tonnes (millions)")
```

Looking at production (in million tonnes) only soybeans seem to have a breakpoint after the financial crisis. Maize seem to have a breakpoint some years before. Also soybeans seem to be the only one where the yield is steadily increasing.

At first glance, both Soybean and Maize seem to have increased in production after 2009. Oil palm fruit seem to grow at a rather constant rate. Sugar cane on the other hand seem to be declining.

### Flex crops area harvested

```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Area harvested"
#crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, flex_crops, measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = flex_crops, y_axis_text = "Hectares (thousands)")
```

The area harvested for Oil palm fruit seem to be increasing exponentially in the last decades. Sugar cane could have reached a peak in its area harvested. Most of their breakpoints seem to come earlier that the financial crisis.

### Flex crops yield

```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Yield"
#crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, flex_crops, measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = flex_crops, y_axis_text = "tonnes per hectare (thousands)")
```

Only soybeans is steadily increasing over time, and well so in the last few years. The yield for maize has a breakpoint and could be peaking.

### Emerging flex crops production

Some plots are missing break points. This is because of a bug in segmented package which has not been resolved yet, see:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12135400/errors-in-segmented-package-breakpoints-confusion
The data has to be "nearly countinous" and a sharp change in a time series could perhaps be an explanation to why it fails to find breakpoints. There is a sharp change in production of crops (especially the emerging ones) after the fall of the soviet union and this could perhaps be a reason for why the segmented-package has trouble to handle the data.

## Global aggregation of production, area harvested and yield

### Between crop categories (absolute values)
Time series of total production, area harvested and yield of flex crops and non flex crops. Non flex crops is just defined as all other crops that are not defined as flex crops or emerging flex crops.

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}

#crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, all_crops, harvest_measure, year)
time_series_category_plot(crop_data, index_plot = FALSE, scale = "free_y")

```

### Between crop categories (proportional)
What proportion is each category of the total production.

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}

#crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, all_crops, harvest_measure, year)
time_series_crop_comparison_plot_proportion(crop_data)


```

The proportion of flex crops production and area harvested has increased significantly, meaning that flex crops has increased relatively and not just in absolute numbers. The most interesting pattern here is that the increased proportion of global flex crop production means that it could pass the non flex crops in a near future. The emerging flex crop has increased some in proportion the area harvested but not in production. Also interesting is that yield of flex crops has fallen over time, which I would have expected to increase.

## Global aggregation of individual flex crop production, area harvested and yield.
Time series (as a proportion of all flex crops)

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}

measure = c("Production", "Area harvested")
#crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, all_crops, harvest_measure, year)
time_series_crop_comparison_plot(crop_data, category = "Flex crop", measure, fraction = TRUE)

```


## Time series of individual emerging flex crop production, area harvested and yield as a proportion of all emerging flex crops.

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}

measure = c("Production", "Area harvested")
#crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, all_crops, harvest_measure, year)
time_series_crop_comparison_plot(crop_data, category = "Emerging flex crop", measure, fraction = TRUE)

```

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 20, echo = FALSE}

#crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, c("Potatoes"), harvest_measure, year)
#time_series_crop_comparison_plot(crop_data, category = "Non flex crop", index_plot = FALSE)
