### Point plot of flex crops (2017)
Plots the production of flex crops for the top 20 countries

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
# Make time series plot of flex crops
#fig.width=5, fig.height = 10"

production_year = "2017"
measure = "Production"
n_countries = 10

point_plot(crop_data %>% filter(flex_crop_category == "Flex crop"), measure, production_year, n_countries)

#t1 = point_plot(crop_data, flex_crops[1], production_year)
#t2 = point_plot(crop_data, flex_crops[2], production_year)
#t3 = point_plot(crop_data, flex_crops[3], production_year)
#t4 = point_plot(crop_data, flex_crops[4], production_year)

#grid.arrange(t1, t2, t3, t4, nrow = 2)

```

As expected, the US, Brazil and Argentina have the greates production of Soybeans. Brazil and India have the most of sugar cane production. Indonesia and Malaysia ha most of the Oil palm fruit and the US, China, Brazil and Argentina have the most Maize.

Interesting is that in the top 20 there are some eastern european countries for both Soybeans and Maize, Ukraine especially but also Romania, Serbia and Hungary.

### Point plot of emergin flex crops (2017)
Plots the production of emerging flex crops for the top 20 countries

```{r out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
# Make time series plot of flex crops

production_year = "2017"
measure = "Production"
n_countries = 10

point_plot(crop_data %>% filter(flex_crop_category == "Emerging flex crop"), measure, production_year, n_countries)

```

Ukraine is again in the top of Sugar beet, Rapeseed and Sunflower seed.

## Break point analysis of global production of flex crops 2000 - 2017
Plots time series of the aggregated total production of individual flex crops.

### Flex crops
The two vertical lines are the breakpoints (using segmented package in r specifying n = 2 breaks)

```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Production"
crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, flex_crops, harvest_measure = measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = flex_crops)
```

Looking at production (in million tonnes) only soybeans seem to have a breakpoint after the financial crisis, both in production and area harvested. Maize seem to have a breakpoint some years before. Also soybeans seem to be the only one where the yield is steadily increasing.

```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Area harvested"
crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, flex_crops, harvest_measure = measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = flex_crops)
```

```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Yield"
crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, flex_crops, harvest_measure = measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = flex_crops)
```

Most flex crops seem to either reach a peak or decrease when it comes to yield. Only soybeans is steadily increasing over time.

# Emerging flex crops
Some plots are missing break points. This is because of a bug in segmented package which has not been resolved yet, see:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12135400/errors-in-segmented-package-breakpoints-confusion
Another one says that is has to be nearly countinous, a sharp change in a time series could perhaps be an explanation to why it fails to find breakpoints:

```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Production"
crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, emerging_flex_crops, harvest_measure = measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = emerging_flex_crops)
```


```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Area harvested"
crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, emerging_flex_crops, harvest_measure = measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = emerging_flex_crops)
```


```{r, fig.height=6, include=TRUE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
measure = "Yield"
crop_data = get_crop_data(crop_production_data_raw, emerging_flex_crops, harvest_measure = measure, year)
break_point_plot(crop_data, measure = measure, crops = emerging_flex_crops)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, fig.height=6, include=FALSE, out.height="100%", out.width="100%"}
# Make time series plot of flex crops

category = "Flex crop"
measure = "Production"

time_series_plot(crop_data, category, measure, scale = "free_y")

```

At first glance, both Soybean and Maize seem to have increased in production after 2009. Oil palm fruit seem to grow at a rather constant rate. Sugar cane on the other hand seem to be declining.

### Global production of emerging flex crops 2000 - 2017
