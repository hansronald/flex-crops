The indicator describes the shares of different land use types at national, regional and global levels over time for the following elements (in %): i) Share in Land area; ii) Share in Agricultural land and iii) Share in Forest land.Time series vary by the underlying data availability of each land use type.Data of “Agricultural land” and its sub-categories: “Arable land”; “Land under permanent crops”; “Land under permanent meadows and pastures”; and “Land area equipped for irrigation” are available from 1961 onward. Data of “Agriculture area actually irrigated” are available since 2001 to present. Data for the component “Agriculture area under organic agriculture” are available from 2004 onward. Data of “Forest land” and of its sub-components “Primary Forest”, “Other naturally regenerated forest” and “Planted Forest” are available since 1990. Last available year is 2016."

"6.0","Formal Set of Instructions","Institutional mandate","Article I of the constitution indeed requires the Organization to collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture (the term “agriculture” and its derivatives includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture). The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the rationale: “If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.” Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000 when formulating the Organization’s strategic thrusts for the 2000-2015 period: Corporate Strategy E1 commits the Organization to building “an integrated information resource base, with current, relevant and reliable statistics, information and knowledge made accessible to all FAO clients."

"6.2","Formal Set of Instructions","Data sharing","FAO annual questionnaire on Land use, Irrigation and Agricultural practices is the primary source of country land-use data. Data are collected through the questionnaire from official national sources. Starting from 2001, the land-use questionnaire was revised in order to obtain further information on the land-use sub-categories as well as on the areas that are actually irrigated. Since 2010, the FAO Statistics Division Land Use questionnaire gathers information on the land used for organic agriculture and land in conversion to organic agriculture. If official data about Organic land have not been provided, the information has been supplemented by other sources such as the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL and the Mediterranean Organic Agriculture Network, MOAN.
